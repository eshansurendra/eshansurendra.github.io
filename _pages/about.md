I am a second-year engineering undergraduate at [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/), currently studying at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering.Currently in my 4th semester, I am interested in the fields Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and TinyML. With a strong passion for exploring the fields of Deep Learning and Machine Learning, I am dedicated to understanding and applying these technologies to solve real-world problems.

Beyond my coursework as an active member of [SLRC Branch of the Electronic Club](https://ent.uom.lk/electronic-club-about/#SLRC-Branch),where I have volunteered on various projects. Specially as a Co-Chair of the [Sri Lankan Robotics Challenge](https://ent.uom.lk/eclub-events/slrc/) I've gained invaluable hands-on experience.
