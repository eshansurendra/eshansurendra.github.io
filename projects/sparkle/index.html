The robot features:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Line Following &amp; Obstacle Avoidance:</strong> Implements a line-following algorithm using phototransistors and obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors. This enables Sparkle to navigate pre-defined paths while avoiding collisions.</li> <li> <strong>Ramp Navigation &amp; Box Dragging:</strong> Utilizes a robust mechanical design with a geared motor system to enable Sparkle to ascend ramps and drag boxes.</li> <li> <strong>Box Picking &amp; Color Detection:</strong> A custom SolidWorks-designed robotic arm powered by a servo motor allows for precise box picking. A color sensor integrated into the arm enables Sparkle to differentiate between different colored boxes.</li> <li> <strong>Maze Solving:</strong> Employs a left-hand rule algorithm, guided by color sensing, to navigate mazes. Sparkle utilizes the box color to determine the correct path and destination within a maze environment.</li> <li> <strong>Sound Detection:</strong> Incorporates an audio sensor that allows Sparkle to detect and respond to specific sound cues, enabling dynamic interactions and programmed actions based on sound triggers.</li> </ul> <h3 id="demo">Demo</h3> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/sparkle/clip.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""></video> </figure> </div> </div> <h3 id="team-collaboration">Team Collaboration</h3> <p>This project was a collaborative effort, and the success of Sparkle Robot is a testament to the dedication and diverse skillsets of the team members:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Eshan Surendra:</strong></li> <li><strong>Achira Hansindu:</strong></li> <li><strong>Pulindu Vidmal:</strong></li> <li><strong>Navini Jagoda:</strong></li> <li><strong>Akhila Prabodha:</strong></li> </ul> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sparkle/team-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sparkle/team-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sparkle/team-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/sparkle/team.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Team Memebers" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Each team member played a crucial role, bringing their unique expertise to the project, and their collaborative spirit was essential in overcoming challenges and achieving a successful outcome.</p> <p>This project, showcasing the combined efforts of the team, serves as a valuable learning resource for anyone interested in exploring the field of robotics and building their own intelligent machines.</p> </body></html>
