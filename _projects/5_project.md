### Features

Sparkle Robot is built around the Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller, serving as the central processing unit for its various functionalities. The robot features:

* **Line Following & Obstacle Avoidance:** Implements a line-following algorithm using phototransistors and obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors. This enables Sparkle to navigate pre-defined paths while avoiding collisions.
* **Ramp Navigation & Box Dragging:** Utilizes a robust mechanical design with a geared motor system to enable Sparkle to ascend ramps and drag boxes.  
* **Box Picking & Color Detection:** A custom SolidWorks-designed robotic arm powered by a servo motor allows for precise box picking. A color sensor integrated into the arm enables Sparkle to differentiate between different colored boxes.
* **Maze Solving:** Employs a left-hand rule algorithm, guided by color sensing, to navigate mazes. Sparkle utilizes the box color to determine the correct path and destination within a maze environment.
* **Sound Detection:**  Incorporates an audio sensor that allows Sparkle to detect and respond to specific sound cues, enabling dynamic interactions and programmed actions based on sound triggers.
